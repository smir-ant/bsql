//! Protocol state — state-as-data.
//!
//! Each variant carries its in-flight correlator inline (reforge.md
//! §7.2). Consequence: a transition out of [`ProtoState::AwaitingPingReply`]
//! that fails to consume the inner [`ReplyId`] is a build error — the
//! borrow / move checker forces every transition to handle the carried
//! data explicitly.
//!
//! Phase 1a ships only the variants the Ping flow drives. Per reforge.md
//! §3.5 / §4.6, manufactured variants ("ConnectingStartup", "InTransaction",
//! "Closed", …) are forbidden until their entry/exit code lands in a
//! later sub-phase.
